 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * Welcome to the BBTC projectâ€”BMAGS' Ballistic Trajectory Calculator. This is a cross-platform, scientific simulation engine designed to model the external ballistics of projectiles with high fidelity.
 *
 * BBTC is written entirely in C, and is designed with deep educational value in mind, offering:
 * - Advanced 6DOF modeling with quaternion rotation
 * - Support for all major drag models (G1, G2, G5, G6, G7, G8, GL, GS, GI, RA4)
 * - Realistic atmosphere and environmental effects
 * - Detailed .csv (spreadsheet format---comma-separated values) logging and simulation output
 * - Fully static memory model with no dynamic allocation (no \c malloc , \c realloc , \c calloc , etc.)
 * - Doxygen-formatted documentation
