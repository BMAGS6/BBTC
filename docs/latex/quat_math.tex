\hypertarget{quat_math_overview}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Overview}{Overview}}\label{quat_math_overview}
This section documents the quaternion math used by B.\+B.\+T.\+C. to handle 3D orientation and rotation. Quaternions offer a compact, non-\/singular, and numerically stable method of representing orientations in three dimensions, making them a superior choice over Euler angles or rotation matrices for physics simulations that require smooth, continuous rotational updates.

This ballistic simulator uses quaternions to represent projectile orientation in a rotation-\/aware, drift-\/free way. This is essential in modeling spin-\/stabilized projectiles with gyroscopic precession and nutation effects.

Rotation in 3D space can be represented in multiple ways\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Euler angles}} (yaw, pitch, roll) are intuitive but suffer from {\itshape  gimbal lock }.
\item {\bfseries{Rotation matrices}} are expressive but large (9 values) and can become numerically unstable.
\item {\bfseries{ Axis-\/angle pairs}} are compact but harder to interpolate or apply repeatedly.
\item {\bfseries{ Quaternions}} combine the best of all worlds\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compact\+: only 4 values.
\item Interpolatable.
\item No gimbal lock.
\item Fast composition and inverse operations.
\item Easily convertible to/from axis-\/angle and rotation matrix forms.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

In mathematical terms, a unit quaternion can be expressed as\+:

\[
q = w + xi + yj + zk
\]

where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $ w \in \mathbb{R} $ is the scalar part,
\item $ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ forms the vector part.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For unit quaternions (used in rotation), the constraint is\+:

\[
w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1
\]

In this codebase, quaternions are used to\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Represent projectile orientation in 3D space.
\item Compute orientation updates during simulation.
\item Apply compound rotations via quaternion multiplication.
\item Normalize after integration to maintain unit length.
\end{DoxyItemize}

You provide the following functionality in {\ttfamily \doxylink{quat_8c}{quat.\+c}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{quat_8h}{quat.\+h}\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{group__QuaternionUtilities_gadfcb29fdbc6bb0fed10df905dbe31651}{quat\+\_\+multiply()}} — multiplies two quaternions.
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{group__QuaternionUtilities_ga097c312803a73b7069646847b7b2323c}{quat\+\_\+normalize()}} — ensures unit quaternion normalization.
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{group__QuaternionUtilities_gafaacfb44f8654f8b6061a4978ccb9f52}{quat\+\_\+from\+\_\+axis\+\_\+angle()}} — converts axis-\/angle pairs to quaternions.
\item {\ttfamily quat\+\_\+rotate\+\_\+vec3()} — applies quaternion rotation to a 3D vector.
\item {\ttfamily quat\+\_\+to\+\_\+rotation\+\_\+matrix()} — converts quaternion to 3×3 matrix (optional).
\item Other utility functions for quaternion conjugates and inverses.
\end{DoxyItemize}

These are the backbone of rotational motion in the solver.

\hypertarget{quat_math_update_step}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Quaternion Update Step}{Quaternion Update Step}}\label{quat_math_update_step}
Orientation is updated every time step using the angular velocity vector ( \textbackslash{}omega ), integrated into quaternion space.

Given a quaternion $ q $ and angular velocity $ \omega = (\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z) $, we construct a pure quaternion\+:

\[
\Omega = 0 + \omega_x i + \omega_y j + \omega_z k
\]

Then, the derivative of orientation is\+:

\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} q \cdot \Omega
\]

This differential equation is integrated numerically (e.\+g., via RK4), and the result is normalized to maintain unit length.

\hypertarget{quat_math_future_interpolation}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Optional\+: SLERP (\+Not Implemented)}{Optional: SLERP (Not Implemented)}}\label{quat_math_future_interpolation}
{\bfseries{ SLERP}}, or {\itshape  Spherical Linear int\+ERPolation}, is a method for smoothly interpolating between two orientations represented by unit quaternions.

It has the following properties\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Constant angular velocity interpolation.
\item Always takes the shortest arc between two orientations.
\item Avoids artifacts from linear interpolation or Euler angle blending.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Although {\bfseries{ SLERP is not currently implemented}} in this program, its mathematical definition is provided here for reference\+:

Given two unit quaternions $ q_0 $ and $ q_1 $, and interpolation parameter $ t \in [0, 1] $, the SLERP function is\+:

\[
\mathrm{SLERP}(q_0, q_1, t) = \frac{\sin((1 - t)\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} q_0 + \frac{\sin(t \theta)}{\sin(\theta)} q_1
\]

where $ \theta $ is the angle between $ q_0 $ and $ q_1 $\+:

\[
\cos(\theta) = q_0 \cdot q_1
\]

I am considering implementing SLERP in future revisions to enable smooth interpolation of projectile orientation (e.\+g., for cinematic visualization, camera tracking, or guided munitions).

\hypertarget{quat_math_summary}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Summary}{Summary}}\label{quat_math_summary}
Quaternions are used in this simulator because they are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Robust}} against gimbal lock.
\item {\bfseries{Lightweight}} and fast.
\item {\bfseries{Ideal}} for compound 3D rotations.
\item {\bfseries{ Naturally suited }} to Runge-\/\+Kutta integration.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This implementation is already capable of full quaternion-\/based motion integration, and this provides a powerful foundation for realistic rotational dynamics. The current state of the program leaves the door open for interpolation methods like SLERP, but currently sticks to what’s implemented.
