BBTC supports multiple empirical drag models that reflect various projectile shapes and flight characteristics. These drag models are used to look up the drag coefficient ( C\+\_\+d ) as a function of Mach number, which directly influences aerodynamic resistance in the simulation.

Drag models available\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G1\+: Flatbase with a blunt nose, which is typical of older bullets. Most commonly used drag model used in the market today.
\item G2\+: Aberdeen J projectile (tangential ogive, sharp point). Not very compatible with small arms ammunition, and more so for certain artillery rounds
\item G5\+: Short 7.\+5-\/degree boat tail with a 6.\+19 caliber long tangent ogive
\item G6\+: For flat based "{}spire point"{} type bullets -\/ 4.\+81 calibers long with a 2.\+53 caliber nose and a 6.\+99 caliber secant nose ogive
\item G7\+: Long boat tail with a secant ogive, used for modern VLD bullets. Second most common model in use today---behind G1---and is suited for most modern intermediate and high power rounds. Most modern US military boat tailed bullets match this model.
\item G8\+: Flat base with similar nose design to G7 -\/ 3.\+64 calibers long with a 2.\+18 caliber long nose and a 10 caliber secant nose ogive. The US M2 152 gr .30 cal bullet matches this drag model. Close to the G6 model.
\item GI\+: Converted from the original Ingalls tables, essentially G1. Not recommended for serious use other than illustration or simulation.
\item GL\+: Traditional model used for flat-\/based, round nosed, exposed-\/lead bullets.
\item GS\+: Model based on a 9/16"{} sphere. This model is best suited for spherical projectiles (cannon and musket balls, etc.) and is practically identical for all sizes of sphere.
\item RA4\+: Used for heeled bullets that are most commonly fired from small rimfire rounds (e.\+g. .22LR) and airguns.

These drag models are implemented using CSV lookup tables that provide $ C_d $ values at discrete Mach intervals. During the simulation, the solver determines the projectile\textquotesingle{}s Mach number, locates the appropriate table, and interpolates the drag coefficient accordingly.

\hypertarget{drag_model_equation}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Drag Force Equation}{Drag Force Equation}}\label{drag_model_equation}
The drag force applied to the bullet is given by\+:

\[
   \mathbf{F}_d = -\frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A \|\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\| \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}
   \]

Where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $ \rho $ is the air density
\item $ C_d $ is the drag coefficient from the selected model
\item $ A $ is the bullet’s cross-\/sectional area
\item $ \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}} $ is the velocity of the bullet relative to the air
\end{DoxyItemize}

The direction of the drag force is opposite to the motion relative to the surrounding air. This includes wind if enabled.\hypertarget{drag_model_interpolation}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Interpolation Logic}{Interpolation Logic}}\label{drag_model_interpolation}
Since the tables contain discrete entries, $ C_d $ must be interpolated for smooth physics. BBTC uses binary search followed by linear interpolation for performance and accuracy.

Steps\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Determine the Mach number from the bullet’s speed and speed of sound
\item Use binary search to find the nearest bracketing values in the drag table
\item Apply linear interpolation between those two points to compute an accurate $ C_d $
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This ensures consistent drag calculation even during rapid transonic transitions where $ C_d $ changes dramatically.\hypertarget{environment_units}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Units and Internal Format}{Units and Internal Format}}\label{environment_units}
Drag model tables use dimensionless coefficients and are stored in plain-\/text CSV format. Internally, all physics are computed using SI units\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mach number (unitless)
\item Cross-\/sectional area (m²)
\item Velocity (m/s)
\item Density (kg/m³)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{drag_model_future}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Future Enhancements}{Future Enhancements}}\label{drag_model_future}
Planned upgrades to drag modeling include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Temperature-\/adjusted Reynolds number influence (viscosity effects)
\item Automatic curve smoothing or polynomial fitting
\item User-\/defined drag tables
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Validation routines to test imported tables for monotonicity and resolution
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

BBTC’s drag model system is extensible and central to its accurate aerodynamics engine. The system ensures physically realistic bullet trajectories across a wide range of speeds and shapes.
