# **DISCLAIMER:** 
This simulator is intended **strictly for educational, experimental, and illustrative use.**
 
The physics modeled here — while extensive and precise — _**cannot**_ and _**will not**_ fully
account for every real-world variable in calculating the trajectory of an unguided projectile,
including but not limited to: wind turbulence, bullet manufacturing defects, barrel harmonics,
powder burn rate inconsistencies, bullet deformation from barrel rifling, and real-time atmospheric
changes. These are but a few of the _**many**_ sources of **irreducible error**. This is **NOT** a
military-grade fire control system and should not be treated nor marketed as such.
 
## Therefore:
- **Do NOT** rely on this simulator for critical ballistic targeting in real-world situations;
- **No guarantee of accuracy or fitness for purpose** is provided, express or implied;
- **No liability is assumed whatsoever** for outcomes resulting from the use or misuse of this software;
- **No warranty is provided whatsoever**; this software is **provided as-is**.

## When handling firearms:
- Always **treat _EVERY_ firearm as if it were loaded**, no matter if it is or not;
- Whatever you may be shooting, always **be _certain_ of your target** and **what is _behind_ it**;
- **NEVER** point the muzzle of  a firearm at anything you are not willing to **wound, maim, kill, damage, or destroy**;
- Always keep your **finger _off_ of the trigger** until you are ready to fire.

## When handling ammunition:
- Always use only **ammunition _designed for_ your specific firearm**
- Make sure your ammunition is **not faulty, damaged, or otherwise unfit** to be fired from a gun
    - Firing faulty or damaged ammunition, over-loaded ammunition, or ammunition not intended by the manufacturer to be 
    fired from your firearm can result in **numerous mishaps and accidents**, ranging from simple misfires to the 
    **gun exploding in your face** and causing **serious injury** or **even death**;
- Always handle ammunition as if it is a live/hot;
- Be sure to store ammunition in proper, secure conditions, and **away from extreme heat**;
- Ammunition and live rounds are **explosives**, and should be treated like any other explosive. They _**must**_ be kept away 
from extreme heat and other unfavorable conditions;
- **NEVER** use ammunition for anything other than being fired from a gun and only a gun designed for that ammunition.
