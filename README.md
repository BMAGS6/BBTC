# BMAGS' Ballistic Trajectory Calculator

BBTC is a C23 ballistics library under clean reconstruction. The new design is
library-first, SI-based, allocation-conscious, explicit about model limits, and
intended to support both scientific experimentation and integration with
Cubes of Honor.

## Current status

The rewrite is in **IB0.2a**. This checkpoint contains only:

- a strict C23 CMake/Ninja library target;
- the namespaced CMake alias `bbtc::bbtc`;
- top-level and subproject-aware test defaults;
- a private temporary link anchor; and
- a CTest link smoke test.

There is no ballistic solver, public C API, command-line application, or
validated firing solution in this checkpoint. Those pieces will be added only
after their individual contracts and tests are reviewed.

The accepted reconstruction rules live in
[`docs/design/BBTC_DESIGN_CONTRACT.md`](docs/design/BBTC_DESIGN_CONTRACT.md).
The original implementation remains recoverable from the
`legacy-pre-rewrite` Git tag.

## Build and test

Requirements:

- CMake 3.22 or newer;
- Ninja;
- a C compiler with ISO C23 support.

Configure, build, and test:

```bash
cmake \
    -S . \
    -B build/debug \
    -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DBBTC_BUILD_TESTS=ON

cmake --build build/debug

ctest \
    --test-dir build/debug \
    --output-on-failure
```

`BBTC_BUILD_TESTS` defaults to `ON` when BBTC is the top-level project and
`OFF` when BBTC is included by another CMake project.

## Embedding

The foundation already supports the intended CMake integration shape:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/BBTC)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE bbtc::bbtc)
```

The first public headers will arrive in IB0.2b. Do not depend on the current
private link-anchor symbol; it exists only to verify this empty foundation.

## Safety

BBTC produces experimental model output, not measured pressure data or approved
ammunition-loading instructions. It must never be used to declare a real
cartridge, charge, firearm, or procedure safe. Read
[`DISCLAIMER.md`](DISCLAIMER.md) before using future simulation output.
